# connectbot
Not for majority use as this works for a specially designed robot I created. 

## How it works
Basically the openworm project has mapped the entire nervous system(connectome) of ringworms. Gopigo took the premapped python version of the nervous system and hooked it's muscles triggers to wheel motors and a bump sensor to nose neurons. I forked that source and was able to get my robot to drive itself around and avoid obstecales only using the connectome to make descisions.

## Can I do this too?

You can recreate the robot this way. The source and control system is quite simple to understand if you examine the code. Infact it's scarily simple how the connectome gives the system such good logic.
